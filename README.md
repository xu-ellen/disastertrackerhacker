# Disaster Tracker Hacker

Every year, natural disasters kill around 90,000 people and affect 160 million people worldwide. There has been a general upward trend in natural disaster occurrences since 1980, most likely due to the worsening of climate change. With recent developments in machine learning and enormous amounts of natural disaster datasets, AI has immense capabilities in predicting the occurrence of numerous natural disasters, which can potentially save thousands of lives. There is currently no natural disaster predictor for the generalized public to easily access and use; thus, this project strives to use machine learning techniques to identify correlations in historical data of three major natural disasters to calculate the risk based on user input.

Disaster Tracker Hacker is an accurate, highly-functional projective application that processes vast aggregates of historical data to produce models governing natural disaster risk of the user's location. The three major natural disasters detected are earthquakes, forest fires, and hurricanes. By collecting user data of location and date when the user accesses the website, the Random Forest Regression model produces a depth and magnitude prediction of upcoming earthquakes. The user can also see information about previous natural disasters, such as their locations, dates, and severity, to see if they are in a historical region of natural disaster occurrences.

The ramifications of climate change are evident in the increasingly frequent and drastic natural
disasters occuring annually. Virtually every citizen of the world can benefit from this application,
as no one is immune to the effects of climate change and it is imperative to the livelihood of many to
understand the natural disaster risk of their region. Though there is an abundunce of historical data
regarding natural disasters accessible by the public, until now there has not be an all-encompassing 
application that has honed these resources into a clean probability calculator. 

Disaster Tracker Hacker can be found on https://disastertrackerhacker.herokuapp.com/ as a 
free web-based application. This product may be commercialized as a risk assesment service, such 
as those in the agriculture sector or for real estate insurance entities. In a similar vein, further 
investments will allow us to enhance our promotional efforts as well as expand our modeling to more
niche metrics centered on meteorological or even economic data. The Natural Disaster Tracker Hacker 
has enourmous potential not only the private consumer base sector but in the massive, established 
industries of crude oil, agriculture, natural resources, and real estate.
